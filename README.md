# Making a React Drag and Drop with No Libraries

Many people use React-dnd to implement a drag and drop functionality into their React projects. I would recommend looking at their library if you want to use drag and drop in a project you are working on. Especially since there is support for React-dnd to work on touchscreens. (This method does not work on touchscreens out-of-the-box). But if you want to know how to implement it yourself. This is a great place to start.

## Credit Where Credit is Due

I learned this method from the FreeCodeCamp article [Implement Drag and Drop without external libraries](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/reactjs-implement-drag-and-drop-feature-without-using-external-libraries-ad8994429f1a). So if you find anything in my Repo confusing, maybe visiting his post will help clarify things.
